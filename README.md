# weather-dashboard
## Task
My task was to complete the weather dashboard and to show the current weather and the search history. I wasn't really able to find time to get this done, I couldn't find a reasonable time to get a tutor and I was working on the project. I searched up some solutions for my problems, but had no luck. If you could just let me know what I did wrong it would be great
